# Mecab-native (using PNaCl)
## What on Earth
This is my WIP attempt to run Mecab in the web browser as a PNaCl application.

I noticed [`mecab-emscripten`](https://github.com/fasiha/mecab-emscripten) managed to cross-compile [`mecab`](http://taku910.github.io/mecab/) (Japanese morphological analyzer) to run in JavaScript embedded in a webpage, with no external dependencies. 
This was awesome! But it'd be nice if we could make it way, way faster. Like, moreorless native. But still in a webpage, and still with no dependencies. 
The idea is:

1. Use Clang to compile `mecab` to LLVM bitcode
2. NaCl SDK's Clang-based toolchain goes a bit further and packages this bitcode into a PNaCl `pexe`
3. Put `pexe` in webpage
4. ????
5. Profit

Ultimately if we can get fast `mecab` in a webpage, we can have cool browser extensions and dictionaries. We can revive the [`furigana-injector`](https://github.com/akira-kurogane/furigana-injector) plugin; this relied on `mecab`, but could only consume the `mecab` service by relying on a web server (now shut down) willing to invoke the `mecab` binary.

It would also be pretty neato if this could ever work as a Node extension. Well, Node doesn't have PNaCl, but maybe it or Io.js could have support one day. Imagine if `npm install mecab` worked, and without dependencies. :)

### What's working?
- It compiles!!
- We can pass args to it in a webpage!
- It can spit out (for example) the '--help' spiel!
- It can grab a file over HTTP before running mecab_do()!
 - Necessary since we have no access to filesystem, but need to provide things like `.mecabrc`.

### What ain't working?
- Need to treat `libiconv` differently if ever we want to share this thing around. 
Not really sure what I'm looking at:

```
*** Warning: Linking the shared library libmecab.la against the
*** static library /Users/birch/git/mecab-emscripten/lib/libiconv_1.14_pnacl/payload/lib/libiconv.a is not portable!
```

- Although I have loaded `.mecabrc` over HTTP, I have not passed its contents anywhere meaningful
 - On invocation (unless you invoke with `--help` switch), we get complaint that it can't see `.mecabrc`.
- Lots of files related to the dictionary need to be loaded
 - And then parsed
 - And then sent somewhere meaningful
- Obviously I have no idea if the core function of `mecab` is actually still intact.

So, pretty much all the 'build' portion is working nicely. The main work remaining is in dancing around the NaCl sandbox to open the files we need at run-time.

## More preamble

Below chronicles the journey of how I compiled Mecab to LLVM bitcode on Mac OS X, and finalized it as a PNaCl `pexe` that could be embedded in a webpage. The only `./configure` script you need to run will be whichever one is the newest (i.e. scroll to the bottom).

Some of this included a patch made locally to the Python portion of the NaCl toolchain's archiver (`pnacl-ar`) to add support for 'BSD long filenames'. This might've been unnecessary and just compensating for having trouble passing AR flags in correctly. My latest `ARFLAGS` might do the trick just as well.

I've now seen the dictionary folder, and realize Mecab will need to load in a lot more files than I'd thought (which is annoying, given NaCl's sandbox). I don't yet have a plan of attack for this, but perhaps reading the original `mecab-emscripten` repository would give some ideas.

Whatever, here's the (pretty scratchy) notes I wrote. Includes how the cmd line compile script evolved over time (+reasons), as well as any patches I needed to make to `./configure`, PNaCl and `mecab` get things working.

## Notes

Install PNaCl SDK

Configure to be built using PNaCl's Clang toolchain

https://developer.chrome.com/native-client/devguide/devcycle/building

Use gnu++11 as standard library, because `newlib` relies on GNU extensions.

```shell
./configure --with-charset=utf8 CXXFLAGS="-std=gnu++11 -O2" CFLAGS="-O2" CXX="pnacl-clang++"
```


// This might help:
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/native-client-discuss/E5lECqm7tx8
http://magnushoff.com/pnacl.html

We will run all our make and configure in the root directory of the `mecab-emscripten` repository:
https://github.com/fasiha/mecab-emscripten

Add Pepper headers:

```shell
./configure --with-charset=utf8 CXXFLAGS="-std=gnu++11 -O2" CFLAGS="-O2" CPPFLAGS="-I/Users/birch/Documents/nacl_sdk/pepper_41/include" CXX="pnacl-clang++"
```

Add Pepper library path for linking:

```shell
./configure --with-charset=utf8 CXXFLAGS="-std=gnu++11 -O2" CFLAGS="-O2" CPPFLAGS="-I/Users/birch/Documents/nacl_sdk/pepper_41/include" CXX="pnacl-clang++" LDFLAGS="-L/Users/birch/Documents/nacl_sdk/pepper_41/lib/pnacl/Release"
```

Specify libraries to pass to linker:

Don't use -lppapi; doesn't seem to exist at the moment? I used lppapi_simple at a guess.

```shell
./configure --with-charset=utf8 CXXFLAGS="-std=gnu++11 -O2" CFLAGS="-O2" CPPFLAGS="-I/Users/birch/Documents/nacl_sdk/pepper_41/include" CXX="pnacl-clang++" LDFLAGS="-L/Users/birch/Documents/nacl_sdk/pepper_41/lib/pnacl/Release" LIBS="-lppapi_cpp -lppapi_simple"
```

We don't need shared anyway (I hope?), so get rid of Makefile switches that clang doesn't understand

```shell
./configure --with-charset=utf8 CXXFLAGS="-std=gnu++11 -O2" CFLAGS="-O2" CPPFLAGS="-I/Users/birch/Documents/nacl_sdk/pepper_41/include" CXX="pnacl-clang++" LDFLAGS="-L/Users/birch/Documents/nacl_sdk/pepper_41/lib/pnacl/Release" LIBS="-lppapi_cpp -lppapi_simple" --disable-shared
```

```shell
// libless just in case useful:
./configure --with-charset=utf8 CXXFLAGS="-std=gnu++11 -O2" CFLAGS="-O2" CXX="pnacl-clang++" --disable-shared
```

Default AR and ARFLAGS (Clang, cru) might work, but you need to add support to PNaCl for BSD long filenames.

`# AR_FLAGS="-crfu"`
`# AR="pnacl-ar"`
Mecab's `configure` needs to tell LLVM archiver to use `f` modifier, to avoid BSD long filenames
Err, `f` flag doesn't work as advertised.
Guess we just use the default AR and AR_FLAGS.
Additionally can't figure out how to use `pnacl-ar` for archiving. So I will use the default clang.
Instead of avoiding BSD long filename, I added support to `artools.py` in PNaCl:

```python
# BSD style long names (totally supported, baby)
    if self.name.startswith('#1/'):
      parse_name_length = re.search(r"#1/(\d+)", self.name)
      name_length_bytes_dec = parse_name_length.group(1)
      # how many bytes to read after header
      name_length_bytes = int(name_length_bytes_dec)

      self.file_contents_bytes = self.size-name_length_bytes
      self.size = self.file_contents_bytes

      file_data = fp.read(name_length_bytes)
      self.name = file_data
      self.is_bsd_long_name = True
```

Uh, move this code to be ABOVE the check for `self.is_bsd4_symtab = (self.name == '__.SYMDEF SORTED')`.

On Mac OS X, neeed to comment out all references to the `bind_at_load` linker switch (this is in `libtool` and `ltmain.sh`), since PNaCl toolchain doesn't recognise it:

```shell
	# Don't allow lazy linking, it breaks C++ global constructors
	# But is supposedly fixed on 10.4 or later (yay!).
	# if test "$tagname" = CXX ; then
	#   case ${MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET-10.0} in
	#     10.[0123])
	#       func_append compile_command " ${wl}-bind_at_load"
	#       func_append finalize_command " ${wl}-bind_at_load"
	#     ;;
	#   esac
	# fi
```

Download & extract PNaCl iconv lib from naclports Continuous Build server (for example http://gsdview.appspot.com/naclports/builds/pepper_41/trunk-253-g089940f/packages/libiconv_1.14_pnacl.tar.bz2)
Add pnacl iconv lib to lib path and include path:
```shell
./configure --with-charset=utf8 CXXFLAGS="-std=gnu++11 -O2" CFLAGS="-O2" CPPFLAGS="-I/Users/birch/Documents/nacl_sdk/pepper_41/include -I/Users/birch/git/mecab-emscripten/lib/libiconv_1.14_pnacl/payload/include" CXX="pnacl-clang++" LDFLAGS="-L/Users/birch/Documents/nacl_sdk/pepper_41/lib/pnacl/Release -L/Users/birch/git/mecab-emscripten/lib/libiconv_1.14_pnacl/payload/lib" LIBS="-lppapi_cpp -lppapi_simple" --disable-shared
```

Use PNaCl AR:
```shell
./configure --with-charset=utf8 CXXFLAGS="-std=gnu++11 -O2" CFLAGS="-O2" CPPFLAGS="-I/Users/birch/Documents/nacl_sdk/pepper_41/include -I/Users/birch/git/mecab-emscripten/lib/libiconv_1.14_pnacl/payload/include" CXX="pnacl-clang++" LDFLAGS="-L/Users/birch/Documents/nacl_sdk/pepper_41/lib/pnacl/Release -L/Users/birch/git/mecab-emscripten/lib/libiconv_1.14_pnacl/payload/lib" LIBS="-lppapi_cpp -lppapi_simple" --disable-shared AR_FLAGS="-crfu" AR="pnacl-ar"
```

Use PNaCl ranlib:
```shell
./configure --with-charset=utf8 CXXFLAGS="-std=gnu++11 -O2" CFLAGS="-O2" CPPFLAGS="-I/Users/birch/Documents/nacl_sdk/pepper_41/include -I/Users/birch/git/mecab-emscripten/lib/libiconv_1.14_pnacl/payload/include" CXX="pnacl-clang++" LDFLAGS="-L/Users/birch/Documents/nacl_sdk/pepper_41/lib/pnacl/Release -L/Users/birch/git/mecab-emscripten/lib/libiconv_1.14_pnacl/payload/lib" LIBS="-lppapi_cpp -lppapi_simple" --disable-shared AR_FLAGS="-crfu" AR="pnacl-ar" RANLIB="pnacl-ranlib"
```

Now having problems with multiply-defined symbols at link-time.

Get rid of stdc++ lib from `./configure`:
```shell
# LIBS="-lstdc++  $LIBS"

â€¦

# if test "x$ac_cv_lib_stdcpp_main" = xyes; then :
#   MECAB_LIBS="-lstdc++"
# fi
```

Try ppapi lib (fails `./configure` check of whether your C compiler works):

Use PNaCl ranlib:
```shell
./configure --with-charset=utf8 CXXFLAGS="-std=gnu++11 -O2" CFLAGS="-O2" CPPFLAGS="-I/Users/birch/Documents/nacl_sdk/pepper_41/include -I/Users/birch/git/mecab-emscripten/lib/libiconv_1.14_pnacl/payload/include" CXX="pnacl-clang++" LDFLAGS="-L/Users/birch/Documents/nacl_sdk/pepper_41/lib/pnacl/Release -L/Users/birch/git/mecab-emscripten/lib/libiconv_1.14_pnacl/payload/lib" LIBS="-lppapi_cpp -lppapi_simple" --disable-shared AR_FLAGS="-crfu" AR="pnacl-ar" RANLIB="pnacl-ranlib"
```

Use `PNaCl-clang` for C, set cross-compiling to `maybe`:

```shell
./configure --with-charset=utf8 CC="pnacl-clang" CXXFLAGS="-std=gnu++11 -O2" CFLAGS="-O2" CPPFLAGS="-I/Users/birch/Documents/nacl_sdk/pepper_41/include -I/Users/birch/git/mecab-emscripten/lib/libiconv_1.14_pnacl/payload/include" CXX="pnacl-clang++" LDFLAGS="-L/Users/birch/Documents/nacl_sdk/pepper_41/lib/pnacl/Release -L/Users/birch/git/mecab-emscripten/lib/libiconv_1.14_pnacl/payload/lib" LIBS="-lppapi_cpp -lppapi -lppapi_simple" --disable-shared AR_FLAGS="-crfu" AR="pnacl-ar" RANLIB="pnacl-ranlib" cross_compiling=maybe
```

Maybe try without iconv, since it is perhaps failing to find this dependency at runtime?

`--without-libiconv-prefix`
```shell
./configure --with-charset=utf8 CC="pnacl-clang" CXXFLAGS="-std=gnu++11 -O2" CFLAGS="-O2" CPPFLAGS="-I/Users/birch/Documents/nacl_sdk/pepper_41/include -I/Users/birch/git/mecab-emscripten/lib/libiconv_1.14_pnacl/payload/include" CXX="pnacl-clang++" LDFLAGS="-L/Users/birch/Documents/nacl_sdk/pepper_41/lib/pnacl/Release -L/Users/birch/git/mecab-emscripten/lib/libiconv_1.14_pnacl/payload/lib" LIBS="-lppapi_cpp -lppapi -lppapi_simple" --disable-shared AR_FLAGS="-crfu" AR="pnacl-ar" RANLIB="pnacl-ranlib" cross_compiling=maybe --without-libiconv-prefix
```

And also maybe put ipadic/ folder next to it?

Copy LIBS from tutorial:
`-lppapi_simple -lppapi -lppapi_cpp -lnacl_io`
```shell
./configure --with-charset=utf8 CC="pnacl-clang" CXXFLAGS="-std=gnu++11 -O2" CFLAGS="-O2" CPPFLAGS="-I/Users/birch/Documents/nacl_sdk/pepper_41/include -I/Users/birch/git/mecab-emscripten/lib/libiconv_1.14_pnacl/payload/include" CXX="pnacl-clang++" LDFLAGS="-L/Users/birch/Documents/nacl_sdk/pepper_41/lib/pnacl/Release -L/Users/birch/git/mecab-emscripten/lib/libiconv_1.14_pnacl/payload/lib" LIBS="-lppapi_simple -lppapi -lppapi_cpp -lnacl_io" --disable-shared AR_FLAGS="-crfu" AR="pnacl-ar" RANLIB="pnacl-ranlib" cross_compiling=maybe --without-libiconv-prefix
```

Provide pthread (from tutorial):

```shell
./configure --with-charset=utf8 CC="pnacl-clang" CXXFLAGS="-std=gnu++11 -O2" CFLAGS="-O2" CPPFLAGS="-I/Users/birch/Documents/nacl_sdk/pepper_41/include -I/Users/birch/git/mecab-emscripten/lib/libiconv_1.14_pnacl/payload/include" CXX="pnacl-clang++" LDFLAGS="-L/Users/birch/Documents/nacl_sdk/pepper_41/lib/pnacl/Release -L/Users/birch/git/mecab-emscripten/lib/libiconv_1.14_pnacl/payload/lib -pthread" LIBS="-lppapi_simple -lppapi -lppapi_cpp -lnacl_io" --disable-shared AR_FLAGS="-crfu" AR="pnacl-ar" RANLIB="pnacl-ranlib" cross_compiling=maybe --without-libiconv-prefix
```

make also:

```shell
./configure --with-charset=utf8 CC="pnacl-clang" CXXFLAGS="-std=gnu++11 -O2" CFLAGS="-O2" CPPFLAGS="-I/Users/birch/Documents/nacl_sdk/pepper_41/include -I/Users/birch/git/mecab-emscripten/lib/libiconv_1.14_pnacl/payload/include" CXX="pnacl-clang++" LDFLAGS="-L/Users/birch/Documents/nacl_sdk/pepper_41/lib/pnacl/Release -L/Users/birch/git/mecab-emscripten/lib/libiconv_1.14_pnacl/payload/lib -pthread" LIBS="-lppapi_simple -lppapi -lppapi_cpp -lnacl_io" --disable-shared AR_FLAGS="-crfu" AR="pnacl-ar" RANLIB="pnacl-ranlib" cross_compiling=maybe --without-libiconv-prefix && make clean && make && pnacl-finalize src/mecab -o /Users/birch/Documents/nacl_sdk/pepper_41/getting_started/me/mecab.final.pexe
```

I think I saw the linker still try to link to libiconv despite the --without-libiconv-prefix switch; maybe I'm using it wrong. it complained that my libiconv wasn't portable.

Major changes to Mecab source have followed. I suggest checking what went down in the `urlloadconfig` branch (since merged into master).
